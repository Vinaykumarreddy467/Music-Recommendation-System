 
**Music_Recommendation_System_Content_Based**

introduction
- music recommendation system that uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to suggest songs based on user input.

Features

- User-friendly interface for inputting text queries (e.g. song titles, artists, genres)
- NLP-powered query analysis to extract relevant keywords and entities
- Knowledge graph-based recommendation engine that considers user preferences and music relationships

How it Works

- User inputs text query (e.g. "songs like Happy by Pharrell Williams")
- NLP algorithms analyze query to extract keywords (e.g. "Happy", "Pharrell Williams", "pop")
- Knowledge graph is queried to find related songs and artists
- Recommendation engine generates a list of suggested songs based on user preferences and music relationships
- Results are ranked by relevance and popularity

Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- scikit-learn
- Music streaming platform APIs (e.g.: Spotify)

Getting Started

- Clone the repository
- Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt
- Run the application with python (python3 -m streamlit run app.py)


 
Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- scikit-learn
- Music streaming platform APIs ( Spotify)

Step 1: Clone the Repository

- Open a terminal or command prompt
- Run the command git clone (link unavailable) 

Step 2: Install Dependencies

- Navigate to the cloned repository directory 
- Run the command pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Set up Music Streaming API Credentials

- Create a file named credentials.json in the repository directory
- Add your music streaming platform API credentials to the file (e.g. Spotify client ID and secret)

Step 4: Run the Application

- Navigate to the repository directory (cd Yed)
- Run the command python (python -m streamlit run app.py)

Step 5: Access the Application

- Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:5000
- Input a text query (e.g. "songs like Happy by Pharrell Williams") and press Enter
- View the recommended songs and listen to them directly from the music streaming platform.




1. *Data Collection:*
   - Dataset Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notsh...

2. *Text Preprocessing:*
   - Clean and preprocess the text by removing special characters, punctuation, and converting all letters to lowercase.
   - Tokenize the descriptions into individual words or phrases.
   - Remove stopwords (common words like "and," "the," "is," etc.) that don't provide much context.

3. *Feature Extraction:*
   - Convert the tokenized descriptions into numerical representations that can be used by machine learning models. You can use techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) or word embeddings (Word2Vec, GloVe) for this purpose.

4. *Building a Recommender Model:*
   - Choose a recommendation algorithm. Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering are two common approaches.
   
   *Content-Based Filtering:*
   - In your case, content-based filtering might be more suitable since you're focusing on analyzing the video descriptions. This approach recommends items similar to those the user has shown interest in.
   - Calculate similarity scores between videos based on their preprocessed descriptions and feature representations.
   - Recommend videos that have similar descriptions to the ones the user has liked or interacted with in the past.

5. *User Interaction and Recommendations:*
   - Allow users to input their preferences, e.g., by providing a sample video URL or keywords related to their interests.
   - Use the selected video's description for recommendation.
   - Rank the videos based on similarity scores and present the top recommendations to the user.
